  <p> This class teaches us how to code. It is fun, but sometimes I wish I could sleep in. I almost bought a fish last weekend but then I decided against it because I would probably kill it accidentally. One day I hope to buy a fish that I can take care of. </p>
  <h2> Possible Fish Names: </h2>
  <p> Here are the names I am considering for my future fish: Nathaniel, Bryce Carper, Sir Swimmy, Joe, Stephanie.</p>
