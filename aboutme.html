  <p> I'm 16 years old, and will be entering my junior year at Bethesda Chevy Chase High School after spending two years at the Maret School. I've always loved working with my hands and creating art to put up on my walls. In my free time I like to read, workout, and relax with my friends. A fun fact about me is that I hope to become a certified scuba diver!  </p>
