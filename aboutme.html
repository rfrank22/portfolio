  <p> Hi! I almost bought a fish last weekend but then I decided against it because I would probably kill it accidentally. I was going to buy a betta fish because they are really pretty, but now I'm kind of leaning towards goldfish. One day I hope to buy a fish that I can take care of. </p>
  <h3> Possible Fish Names: </h3>
  <p> Here are the names I am considering for my future fish: Nathaniel, Bryce Carper, Sir Swimmy, Stephanie.</p>
  <h3> Goldfish </h3>
